## answers for the questions

1. If I had more time on this test, 
  - I would have add more test cases.
  - I would add more validations for given parameters.
  - I would seperate functions more in detail(like, sorting function used in getStores function.)

2. The hardest part was,
  - to find the best URI to look RESTful(how to show resource in URI).
  - to find the best folder structure(because the best initial design is that never changes).

3. The most proud part was,
  - I tried to design folder structure flexible for future expandability.
  - This was my first time writing test codes in javascript.
  
4. For now I don't come up with special ideas to improve this test. I was quite satisfied with this task as it was a great chance to improve my skill. However, if I must say, what about, let API consumer can post, delete, update data?
